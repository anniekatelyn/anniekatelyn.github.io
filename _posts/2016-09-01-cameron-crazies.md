Created an iOS application for Duke students to use during tenting season to coordinate schedules, keep up with tent checks and K-Ville events, etc.

*Tenting: Duke students form organized groups and sleep in tents from January - February in order to secure spots in the yearly Duke-UNC home game at Cameron Indoor Stadium. There's a reason why we call ourselves the Cameron Crazies.*
